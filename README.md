# Personal thoughts on the CTF
It has been an interesting CTF I would say, just doing my challenges in my own time actually allowed me to solve more challenges. This could be perhaps due to the fact that I was not really taking it seriously, like previously with the Gryphons CTF. It allowed me to really explore and just us the tools and knowledge that I had from participating in other CTFs and applying it to the various challenges. Overall, I would say that this CTF was actually easier than the first Interpoly CTF and the difficulty level was what I expected for a CTF meant for tertiary students.
